# Text-Midi
A Midi to Text converter with timings made for compatibility with Scratch and other programming languages that do not have direct Midi support.

**Supporting This Format:**

To support this format it is fairly simple but still does require some work, if you are using scratch theres a premade system already on my account (same username as my github). Other languages might be harder but its generally straight forward (start timing),(end timing)'(note)' is the how it looks, 0.000,0.076'61' is a example of a full note each note is on a different line.

Also theres a example file in the repository of a midi in this format.
